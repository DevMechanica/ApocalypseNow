    <!-- We will use a bundler (Parcel/Vite) normally, but since we just did npm install phaser:
         We might need to use a bundler or point to node_modules/phaser/dist/phaser.js if we aren't using a build step.
         However, 'import Phaser from "phaser"' implies a module bundler.
         Given the user environment, I should probably check if they want a bundler.
         The prompt said "Create package.json and install Phaser".
         If I don't set up a bundler, 'import' won't work for 'phaer' bare key.
         I will use a simple importmap or assume a build step later? 
         Wait, user didn't ask for a bundler, but "main.js" having "import" requires one or native ES modules with paths.
         Native ES modules need "./node_modules/phaser/dist/phaser.esm.js" or similar.
         Let's assume we can use Vite or Parcel for ease, OR just use the relative path for now if we want to stay simple.
         Actually, to keep it simple and effective as requested in "Web Application Development", I should probably use Vite.
         But I already did `npm init`. I can `npm install vite --save-dev`.
         Let's try to stick to native modules first if possible, or just add a simple build script.
         Actually, the easiest way for "ApocalypseNow" is properly a quick Vite setup.
         But for now, I will point to main.js and we can resolve the build in the Verification step or just use <script type="module" src="src/main.js"></script> and fix imports.

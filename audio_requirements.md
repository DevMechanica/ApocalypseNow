# 🎵 Audio Design Document: [Apo-Now]
**Project:** Apo-Now  
**Status:** Active  
**Date:** February 2026  

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The musical identity of "Apo-Now" must match its visual style: **hand-painted, high-resolution, and organic**. The soundscape should feel "scavenged"—rusty, worn-out, and lonely, but with a warm, "lived-in" feeling for the bunker.

> **CRITICAL MILESTONE:** > "Main Theme" draft required by: **END OF FEBRUARY** > *(Used to establish the emotional baseline for the rest of the game).*

## 2. Asset List & Deliverables (Total: 6–8 Tracks)

### **[TRACK 01] Main Theme (Title Screen)**

* **Quantity:** 2 Tracks
* **Duration:** 3:00 – 4:30 minutes

## 3. Genres & Style Guide

* **AESTHETIC:** Hand-crafted, organic, worn-out.
* **PRIMARY GENRE:** Dark Americana / Post-Apocalyptic Folk.
    * *Think:* Acoustic but sad. *The Last of Us* or *Metro Exodus* guitar tracks.
* **SECONDARY GENRE:** Industrial Ambient.
    * *Think:* Background drones made from slowed-down sounds of fans, metal groans, and humming pipes.

### 🚫 Strict Constraints
* **NO** 8-bit / Chiptune sounds.
* **NO** clean digital techno.
* **NO** epic orchestral scores.
* *Instruments must sound "old" and textured.*

## 4. Key Notes & Instrumentation

### **Musical Key**
* **A Minor** or **E Minor** (The "Sad Guitar" keys).
* *Tip:* Occasionally dipping into **Phrygian Mode** gives it that "survival tension" feel without sounding like a horror game.

### **Instrumentation Palette**
1.  **Acoustic Guitar:** Played slowly, with slight reverb (to sound like it's being played in a tunnel).
2.  **Cello/Violin:** Low, scratchy bowing techniques (*sul ponticello*) to create tension.
3.  **Metallic Percussion:** Instead of drums, use sounds of hitting metal tanks, pipes, or wrenches.
4.  **Harmonica/Melodica:** Sparse usage. Evokes the "lonely wanderer" vibe.

## 5. Reference Library & Vibe Check

### **A. The "Surface / Exploration" Vibe (Map View)**
*Goal: Loneliness, wind, scavenged instruments.*

* **"The Last of Us (Main Theme)"** by Gustavo Santaolalla
    * *Why:* Uses a Ronroco (small guitar-like instrument) that sounds hollow and wooden. Feels fragile, like the survivors.
* **"Race Against Fate"** (from *Metro Exodus*)
    * *Why:* A heavy, driving acoustic guitar with a deep cello background. Feels like walking through a ruined city in the rain.
* **"Campfire Stalker"** (from *S.T.A.L.K.E.R.*)
    * *Why:* Very raw, imperfect guitar playing. Sounds like a guy sitting on a crate playing a beat-up guitar he found in the rubble.

### **B. The "Bunker Management" Vibe (Base View)**
*Goal: Productive, rhythmic, warm but metallic.*

* **"Monday"** (from *This War of Mine*)
    * *Why:* Steady, ticking rhythm (like a clock) but sad instruments. Perfect for "working" without being annoying.
* **"Welcome to the City (Violin Edit)"** (from *Frostpunk*)
    * *Why:* The solo violin sounds cold and sharp. Matches the difficulty of survival.
* **"Mass Effect 1 - Vigil"** (Acoustic Covers)
    * *Why:* While the original is sci-fi, the structure of this song is calm and hypnotic. Perfect for menus.

### **C. The "Deep Underground" Vibe (Lower Levels)**
*Goal: Heavy, humming, atmospheric.*

* **"Metallic Monks"** (from *Fallout 1*)
    * *Why:* This is the gold standard for "Industrial Ambient." Sounds like distant air raid sirens and wind howling through metal grates.
* **"Factory Background Noise"** (Generic Soundscapes)
    * *Why:* Sometimes you don't need music; you need a low-frequency "drone" sound mixed with the occasional clank of a wrench.
